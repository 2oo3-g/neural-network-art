## Repo Structure

### Project Description
`Project Description.pdf` - self-explanatory.
The first part is *Binary conversion of job sequences* and the second part is the neural network *ART* itself. Please read this document first.

### Provided Resources
`Resources` folder - contains some brief documents on ART and Binary conversion. Please check them.

### Provided Code
`ProvidedCode/ART.cpp` - Has an implementation of the ART network.
`ProvidedCode/README.txt` - Has the instructions on the ART code file. Must read.

### Other Necessary Resources
I am going to add some parts of the mail our client sent me:

>I have a C++ code for ART( This neural network I am going to use) which might be helpful for you and make the whole to be done faster. Just take a look and let me know what you think.
Note: The code that I am giving is done for different input. Basically, if you crack the code, you just need to modify the >beginning part and the end part according to my requirements which is mentioned in my project description pdf.


>One more thing, you might take a look in the following book to have an idea of ART (Chapter 10 and ART 1 we are using). This book is really good. I have bought the book as I could not download it. I believe you can find an online version of this book free.
